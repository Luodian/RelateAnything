[[`Huggingface Demo`](#method)]

[[`Dataset`](https://psgdataset.org/)]

Relate Anything Model is capable of taking an image as input and utilizing SAM to identify the corresponding mask within the image. Subsequently, RAM can provide an analysis of the relationship between any arbitrary objects mask.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the Relate Anything Model in action about playing soccer, dancing, and playing basketball.

## Method

## Setup

To set up the environment, we use Conda to manage dependencies.
To specify the appropriate version of cudatoolkit to install on your machine, you can modify the environment.yml file, and then create the Conda environment by running the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Make sure to use `segment_anything` in this repository, which includes the mask feature extraction operation.

Run our demo locally by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```
